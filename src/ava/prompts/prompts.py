    You are an expert software architect who specializes in creating plans for Python applications.

    **ADDITIONAL CONTEXT FROM KNOWLEDGE BASE:**
    {rag_context}

    **USER REQUEST:** "{prompt}"

    **INSTRUCTIONS:**
    1.  Your goal is to create a plan for a **Python application**.
    2.  Review the user request and the additional context.
    3.  The main executable script **MUST be named `main.py`**.
    4.  Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object with a single key "files".

    **EXAMPLE RESPONSE (for a simple app):**
    {{
      "files": [
        {{
          "filename": "main.py",
          "purpose": "A single-file stopwatch application using Tkinter for the GUI."

    You are an expert software architect. Your task is to design a robust and modular file structure for a new Python application based on the user's request.

    **USER REQUEST:** "{prompt}"

    **ADDITIONAL CONTEXT FROM KNOWLEDGE BASE:**
    {rag_context}

    **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
    1.  Deconstruct the user's request into a logical, multi-file Python project.
    2.  For each file, provide a concise, one-sentence "purpose" describing its role.
    3.  **A utility module for setting up consistent logging MUST be created at `utils/logging_config.py`**.
    4.  The main executable script **MUST be named `main.py`** and it **MUST call the logging setup function from `utils/logging_config.py` at the very beginning.**
    5.  Identify all necessary pip installable dependencies.
    6.  Your response **MUST** be ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown.
    7.  **DO NOT write any implementation code.** Focus ONLY on the structure.

    **EXAMPLE RESPONSE:**
    {{
      "files": [
        {{ "filename": "utils/logging_config.py", "purpose": "Configures a centralized logging system (e.g., using logging.basicConfig) for the entire application." }},

        {{ "filename": "models.py", "purpose": "Defines the database models, such as the User table." }},
        {{ "filename": "routes.py", "purpose": "Contains all Flask routes for authentication and core features." }}

MODIFICATION_PLANNER_PROMPT = textwrap.dedent("""
    You are an expert senior software developer specializing in refactoring and modifying existing Python codebases.

    **YOUR TASK:**
    Analyze the user's modification request. Based on the **summaries of existing project files** provided below, produce a JSON plan that outlines which files to create or modify.

    **USER'S MODIFICATION REQUEST:** "{prompt}"

    ---
    **CONTEXT ON EXISTING PROJECT:**

    **1. Source Code Structure:**
    {source_root_info}

    **2. Summaries of Existing Files:**
    This is the list of all files in the project. You are provided with a high-level summary for each Python file. You MUST reference these exact file paths.

    {file_summaries_string}
    ---

    **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY:**
    1.  **DO NOT RE-ARCHITECT THE PROJECT:** Your only job is to modify the existing files or add new, secondary files to fulfill the user's request.
    2.  **STRICTLY ADHERE TO EXISTING FILENAMES AND PATHS:** When modifying a file, you MUST use its exact path from the list above (e.g., `todo_app/routes.py`). Do not invent new paths or create duplicate directories.
    3.  **DETERMINE NECESSARY CHANGES:** Based on the user's request, decide which files to modify and which NEW helper files to create (if and only if a new file is truly required).
    4.  **PROVIDE A CONCISE, ONE-SENTENCE PURPOSE:** For each file in your plan, write a clear, specific "purpose" explaining *only the high-level goal* of the changes (e.g., "Add a route to handle task deletion.").
    5.  **DO NOT WRITE IMPLEMENTATION CODE:** The 'purpose' field should not contain any code snippets, just the description of the change.
    6.  **JSON OUTPUT ONLY:** Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not add any other text, explanations, or markdown.

    **EXAMPLE JSON RESPONSE FORMAT:**
    ```json
    {{
      "files": [
        {{
          "filename": "todo_app/routes.py",
          "purpose": "Add a new route for deleting tasks."

        {{
          "filename": "todo_app/templates/index.html",

    **üîç COMPLETE PROJECT CONTEXT (CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY)**

    **1. Full Project Plan:**
    ```json
    {{file_plan_json}}

    **2. Full Code of Files Generated So Far:**
    This JSON object contains the complete source code of the other Python files already written in this session. Use this to ensure perfect integration.

    ```json
    {{symbol_index_json}}
    ```

    ---
    **‚ö° CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - READ AND FOLLOW EXACTLY**

    **1. LOGGING REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
       - **NEVER use `print()` for debugging.** ALWAYS use the `logging` module.
       - At the top of the module, get a logger instance: `import logging` and `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`.
       - Use descriptive logging messages.
       - Use `logger.info()` for startup sequences and major lifecycle events (e.g., "Initializing service...", "Component ready.").
       - Use `logger.debug()` for detailed state information or frequent updates (e.g., `logger.debug(f"Processing item {{item_id}}")`).
       - Use `logger.warning()` for non-critical issues or potential problems.
       - Use `logger.error()` within `except` blocks to log exceptions before re-raising or handling them.

    **2. IMPORT AND INTEGRATION RULES:**
       - Use the symbol index above to ensure 100% accurate imports.
       - If you need class `Player` and the index shows it's in `engine/player.py`, you MUST use: `from engine.player import Player`.
       - Your code must work seamlessly with all existing files in the project.
       - Use exact class names and method signatures from the context.

    **üìã IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:**

    ‚úÖ **Professional Logging**: Followed all logging requirements.
    ‚úÖ **Import Statements**: Used EXACT paths from symbol index.
    ‚úÖ **Class Names**: Matched EXACT names from existing files.
    ‚úÖ **Method Signatures**: Followed patterns in existing code.
    ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Included proper exception handling (`try...except`).
    ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Added docstrings for all classes and complex methods.

    ```diff
