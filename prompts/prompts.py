    2.  Review the user request and the additional context.
    3.  The main executable script **MUST be named `main.py`**.
    4.  Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object with a single key "files".

    **EXAMPLE RESPONSE (for a simple app):**

    You are an expert software architect. Your task is to design a robust and modular file structure for a new Python application based on the user's request.

    **USER REQUEST:** "{prompt}"

    **ADDITIONAL CONTEXT FROM KNOWLEDGE BASE:**
    {rag_context}

    **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
    1.  Deconstruct the user's request into a logical, multi-file Python project.
    2.  For each file, provide a concise, one-sentence "purpose" describing its role.
    3.  The main executable script **MUST be named `main.py`**.
    4.  Identify all necessary pip installable dependencies.
    5.  Your response **MUST** be ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown.
    6.  **DO NOT write any implementation code.** Focus ONLY on the structure.

    **EXAMPLE RESPONSE:**
    {{
      "files": [
        {{ "filename": "main.py", "purpose": "Main application entry point, initializes the Flask app and database." }},
        {{ "filename": "models.py", "purpose": "Defines the database models, such as the User table." }},
        {{ "filename": "routes.py", "purpose": "Contains all Flask routes for authentication and core features." }},

MODIFICATION_PLANNER_PROMPT = textwrap.dedent("""
    You are an expert software architect specializing in refactoring and modifying existing Python codebases.

    **USER'S MODIFICATION REQUEST:** "{prompt}"

    **EXISTING PROJECT FILES (filename: content):**
    ```json
    {existing_files_json}
    ```
    **INSTRUCTIONS:**
    Analyze the user's request and the existing files.
    Determine which files need to be modified and which new files need to be created.
    Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object listing all files that need to be generated.
    For files that need to be MODIFIED, the purpose should describe the change.
    For NEW files, the purpose should describe the file's role.

    **EXAMPLE RESPONSE:**
    {{
        "files": [
            {{
                "filename": "ui_manager.py",
                "purpose": "Modify the main UI class to add a new 'Reset' button and connect it to the timer logic."

CODER_PROMPT = textwrap.dedent("""
    You are an expert Python developer. Your task is to write the code for a single file within a larger project.

    **CONTEXT: FULL PROJECT PLAN**
    This is the complete plan for the application you are helping to build. Use it to understand the relationships between files.
    ```json
    {file_plan_json}
    ```

    **CONTEXT: LIVING DESIGN DOCUMENT (REAL-TIME ANALYSIS)**
    This is a real-time architectural analysis of the project as it's being built. It contains detailed information about classes, functions, and dependencies in already-generated files. Use this as your primary source of truth for how to interact with other parts of the code.
    ```json
    {living_design_context_json}
    ```

    **CONTEXT: BASIC FILE INDEX (FALLBACK)**
    If the Living Design Document is empty, use this basic index of symbols to modules.
    ```json
    {code_summaries_json}
    ```

    **YOUR ASSIGNED TASK**
    - **File to Write:** `{filename}`
    - **Purpose of this File:** `{purpose}`

    **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
    1.  Your response **MUST ONLY** contain the complete, raw code for the single file you were assigned: `{filename}`.
    2.  **DO NOT** include any explanations, comments, or markdown formatting like ```python.
    3.  **DO NOT** write `__init__` methods that just print "Error:". They should properly initialize the class with `self.attribute = value`.
    4.  Ensure the code is robust, clean, and professional.
    5.  Use the "LIVING DESIGN DOCUMENT" and "BASIC FILE INDEX" to write correct and complete import statements.

REFINEMENT_PROMPT = textwrap.dedent("""
    You are an expert Python game developer specializing in the Ursina engine. Your task is to fix a critical bug in a multi-file voxel game project.

    **THE GOAL:**
    Analyze the complete project source code and the provided error traceback. Identify the root cause of the bug and provide the corrected, complete source code for **only the file(s) that need to be changed.**

    **CONTEXT: ENTIRE PROJECT SOURCE CODE**
    This JSON object contains the full source for every file in the project. Use this to understand the relationships and dependencies between modules.
    ```json
    {project_source_json}
    ```

    **THE ERROR THAT OCCURRED:**
    This is the error report. The error occurred in `{error_filename}`.
    ```
    {error_report}
    ```

    **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS & DEBUGGING HINTS:**
    1.  **Analyze the Full Picture:** The bug might be a simple typo in `{error_filename}`, or it could be a deeper architectural issue, like a mismatch in how two files interact. Use the full project context to find the true root cause.
    2.  **Common Ursina `Mesh` Error:** If the error is a `ValueError` related to `Mesh` creation, the most common cause is mismatched data lengths or incorrect data types for `vertices`, `triangles`, or `uvs`. Specifically, `uvs` must be a list of 2D coordinates (like tuples `(u, v)` or `Vec2`), NOT 3D vectors (`Vec3`).
    3.  **Output Format:** Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object. The keys are the filenames that need to change, and the values are their complete, new source code.
    4.  **Be Precise:** Only include files that require changes. If only `chunk.py` needs a fix, only include `chunk.py` in your response.
    5.  **No Explanations:** Do not include any explanations, comments, or markdown formatting outside of the JSON object.

    **EXAMPLE RESPONSE (if only chunk.py needs fixing):**
    ```json
    {{
      "world/chunk.py": "
    # kintsugi_ava/world/chunk.py
    import numpy as np
    from ursina import Entity, Mesh, Vec3, Vec2
    # ... the rest of the complete, corrected code for chunk.py ...
