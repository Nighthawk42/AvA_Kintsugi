**INSTRUCTIONS:**
Analyze the user's request and the existing files.
Determine which files need to be modified and which new files need to be created.
Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object listing all files that need to be generated.
For files that need to be MODIFIED, the purpose should describe the change.
For NEW files, the purpose should describe the file's role.

**EXAMPLE RESPONSE:**
{{
"files": [
{{
"filename": "ui_manager.py",
"purpose": "Modify the main UI class to add a new 'Reset' button and connect it to the timer logic."
